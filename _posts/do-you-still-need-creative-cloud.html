<p>I've been a Creative Cloud customer since Adobe first took their Creative Suite software and offered it as a subscription (back when CS6 came out). At that time I had been freelancing for a couple of months so upgrading to the latest CS version without having to fork out hundreds if not thousands of pounds all in one go seemed like a sensible decision.</p>
<p>During the 3 years that followed, I never really questioned my Adobe subscription. It was a 'necessity'. The tools of the trade. Recently though, I've started to question that.<!--more--></p>
<p>A few weeks ago the Internets went ablaze with anger over Adobe's somewhat reckless use of A/B testing over the price of Creative Cloud. Depending on which browser you used to sign up, you could pay almost £100 per year over the odds… for life. Not a 'first year discount' like you could get if you were already a CS customer, or an 'initial period' - but continuously until you ceased your subscription. Meanwhile us loyal schmucks carry on paying through the nose. Now I am all for competitive pricing models, but for subscription based services such as Adobe's Creative Cloud shouldn't have people being charged 20% more per year - FOREVER - because they got there first.</p>

<h2>THE EFFECT OF BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE</h2>

<p>The first thing I did was talk to Adobe through their support live chat. It wasn't a pleasant experience. After a full 66 minutes of online chat, being ferried through 4 different people, having to explain the situation and my distaste every time, I was finally told that I could receive the 'discounted' rate… providing I cancelled my existing subscription and started a new one. Fine.</p>
<blockquote>To date I've spent over a thousand pounds on Adobe's Creative Cloud service. That's a lot.</blockquote>
<p>Of course, now that I'm a 'new' customer, I have the ability to cancel my subscription for free within 30 days. Which got me thinking. To date I've spent over a thousand pounds on Adobe's Creative Cloud service. That's a lot. As the years have gone by I've found myself using only a couple of specific apps from the suite, namely Photoshop and Illustrator. So if these are the only two apps I really use Creative Cloud for, am I able to find a pair of viable replacements?</p>

<h2>WHY DOES ADOBE DOMINATE?</h2>

<p>If you look at other areas of the industry, they are far less dominated by one set of apps. In 3D while Autodesk still reigns strong, other apps like Blender, zBrush and Cinema4D have their share of the market. In development everyone has their own setup and tools that they use. This also extends to the technology developers choose to learn and use. Depending on the project, they may use different frameworks and libraries. As the need for UX designers has grown, so has the choice of wireframing apps. Axure, Mockups, Omnigraffle and Illustrator all have a following.</p>
<p>Yet design still seems to always fall back to Photoshop and maybe Illustrator if it's required. There are no shortage of competitor applications out there, but none seem to gain any traction as a legitimate replacement. With the push to get out of Photoshop and straight into the browser, are there better tools that make the transition from the traditional design phase into the development phase simpler?</p>

<h2>SHOULD I EVEN BE USING THIS TYPE OF APP?</h2>

<p>My new portfolio (which I really hope to push live in the next couple of weeks) started in the browser. I haven't use Photoshop for anything other than cropping images and artwork. Illustrator has been used for iconography and the creation of SVG graphics. One thing I love is copying graphics from Illustrator and pasting them into Sublime (my text editor of choice) and you get the SVG output. Amazing!</p>
<p>As I was developing my portfolio, I found that I would want to change things because I the interaction wasn't right or the way things scaled in the browser meant that I needed to adjust my design. I think that had I created a fully static mock-up in Photoshop my adaptability would have been affected, making it harder to change things once I realised they didn't quite work once they made it to the browser.</p>

<h2>TIME TO TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT...</h2>

<p>While I am certainly beginning to question my reliability on Adobe, I don't think I am completely ready abandon a pixel or vector based design app. But I'd certainly like to try something different.</p>
<p>Serif's Affinity Designer has hit the industry to some fairly impressive reviews. The first computer graphics I ever created were NBA logo replicas using Serif Draw Plus, so Affinity Designer has some nostalgic added value as a replacement for Illustrator. It apparently can handle PSDs, PDFs and AI files respectably. Which all sounds great. It also costs a minimal £34.99 from the App Store… no subscription required.</p>
<p>With an Illustrator replacement sorted, I don't think it can fully replace Photoshop as well. Which I why I also intend to use Pixelmator. I've heard lots of good reviews about it and am keen to see how it stacks up against Photoshop. At just £21.99 it's hard to argue with.</p>

<h2>WILL IT WORK?</h2>

<p>So as of yesterday, I am no longer a Creative Cloud subscriber. I canceled my 'new' subscription within my first 30 days and so have no penalty fee. Awesome. For the next two months I fully intend to just use Affinity Designer and Pixelmator. Two months means that if I have to go back to Adobe, the cost will work out similar had I just stayed a CC subscriber, plus it gives me enough time to fully try them out. I have no idea how this experiment will go. I may find that I just can't live without Adobe and it's dominating suite of applications. Or I may find that my designs have some new creative freedom as I am forced to work outside of the Adobe bubble. Only time will tell.</p>
<p>I'll be sure to publish how I am getting on, and what I find at the end of the two months. If anyone has any experience trying something similar be sure to tweet at me and let me know your thoughts.</p>
